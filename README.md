# RetroN5-Dumper
Powershell Script to backup roms from a Rooted Hyperkin RetroN5


This script assumes you have Windows 10 or PowerShell 4 installed and your RetroN 5 has already been rooted with ADB enabled.

The powershell script was written to use a ADB.exe executable located in the same directory. Script will fail without ADB.exe.

Fast cartridge loading must be disabled if on firmware 2.4 or higher for proper dumping.
